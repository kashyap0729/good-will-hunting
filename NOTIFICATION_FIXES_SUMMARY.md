# 🛠️ Notification System Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified & Fixed:

### 1. 🐛 HTML Rendering Issue in Frontend
**Problem:** HTML tags were being displayed as raw text instead of rendered HTML
**Solution:** 
- Added HTML tag cleaning to remove any pre-escaped tags
- Improved error handling for notification data
- Added fallback message when no notifications available

### 2. 📊 Backend Notification Endpoints
**Problem:** Only missing-items notifications were shown, no donation notifications
**Solution:**
- ✅ Created `/notifications/recent-donations` endpoint
- ✅ Updated `/notifications/missing-items` to use AI system instead of hardcoded messages  
- ✅ Created `/notifications/all` endpoint combining both types
- ✅ Fixed database query to use correct column name (`donation_date` not `created_at`)

### 3. 🤖 AI Integration Improvements
**Problem:** Missing imports and notification generation inconsistencies
**Solution:**
- ✅ Added proper imports for `NotificationType` in backend
- ✅ Enhanced donation form to show AI notification immediately after donation
- ✅ Added AI indicators with model attribution

### 4. 🔗 Frontend-Backend Integration
