# 🚀 API Timeout Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Gemini AI API Timeouts**
**Problem:** AI calls were taking too long, causing "Timeout: API too slow" errors
**Solutions Applied:**
- ✅ **Optimized generation config**: Reduced max_output_tokens to 100 for faster responses
- ✅ **Shorter prompts**: Simplified prompt from verbose to concise format
- ✅ **Temperature tuning**: Set temperature=0.7 for balanced speed/creativity
- ✅ **Token limits**: Added top_p=0.8, top_k=40 for faster processing

### 2. **Backend API Endpoint Timeouts**
**Problem:** Backend notification endpoints were slow due to multiple AI calls
**Solutions Applied:**
- ✅ **Asyncio timeouts**: Added 15s timeout for missing items, 8s per donation notification
- ✅ **Limited processing**: Reduced missing items from all → 2, donations from 10 → 5
- ✅ **Individual timeouts**: Each notification has its own timeout, failures don't block others
- ✅ **Graceful degradation**: Continues processing if some notifications fail

### 3. **Frontend Request Timeouts**
**Problem:** Frontend requests had fixed 3s timeout regardless of endpoint complexity
**Solutions Applied:**
- ✅ **Smart timeouts**: 20s for notifications, 10s for donations, 5s for regular requests
- ✅ **Better error handling**: Clear timeout messages vs generic errors
- ✅ **Request optimization**: Maintained caching but with endpoint-specific timeouts

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made:

### **notification_agent.py**
```python
# Faster generation config
generation_config = {
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 0.8, 
    "top_k": 40,
    "max_output_tokens": 100,  # Reduced from unlimited
}

# Shortened prompt (was 200+ words, now ~50 words)
def _build_prompt(self, notification_type, context):
    return f"""Generate a short, encouraging notification...
    Type: {notification_type.value}
    Context: {context}
    Requirements: One sentence only, include emoji, be positive"""
```

### **fast_backend.py**
```python
# Async timeout handling
notifications = await asyncio.wait_for(
    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(
        None, notification_agent.generate_notification, ...
    ),
    timeout=8.0  # Individual timeouts
)
```

### **fast_dashboard.py**
```python
# Smart timeout based on endpoint
if "notifications" in endpoint:
    timeout = 20  # AI needs more time
elif method == "POST":
    timeout = 10  # Donations need medium time  
else:
    timeout = 5   # Regular requests are fast
```

## 🎯 Expected Performance:

### **Before Fixes:**
- ⏱️ AI notifications: 30-60+ seconds (often timed out)
- ❌ Multiple API failures
- 🐌 Frontend showed "API too slow" errors

### **After Fixes:**
- ⚡ AI notifications: 5-15 seconds per notification
- ✅ Graceful handling of slow/failed notifications  
- 🚀 Frontend shows partial results instead of complete failure
- 📊 Limited processing prevents overwhelming the AI API

## 🧪 Testing:

Run the timeout test:
```bash
python test_timeout_fixes.py
```

**Expected Results:**
- Each notification should generate in < 10 seconds
- Multiple notifications process sequentially with individual timeouts
- System continues working even if some AI calls fail

## 🚀 Deployment:

1. **Start backend**: `python fast_backend.py`
2. **Start dashboard**: `streamlit run fast_dashboard.py`  
3. **Make donation**: Should see AI notification within 10-15 seconds
4. **Check notifications section**: Should populate without "API too slow" errors

**The API timeout issues are now fixed with smart timeout handling and optimized AI generation!** ⚡🤖
